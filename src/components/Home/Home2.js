  My journey to becoming a software engineer began unexpectedly. I studied 
  <b className="purple"> Civil Engineering</b> during my bachelor's degree. 
  In my final year, I enrolled in a <b className="purple">Python course </b> 
  and immediately fell in love with codingâ€”the way the teacher explained concepts 
  and the creativity behind solving problems fascinated me. From creating patterns 
  like printing a Christmas tree with for loops to experimenting with algorithms, 
  I knew I wanted to explore more. 
  <br />
  <br />
  During my first master's in Civil Engineering, I asked my mentor if I could 
  combine my civil engineering background with software development. This led 
  me to create a <b className="purple">3D concrete crack reconstruction program</b>, 
  which gave me hands-on experience in applying programming to real-world problems. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Since then, I have fully committed to <b className="purple">software development </b> 
  and continue to pursue this path, building applications, improving systems, 
  and working toward my dream of becoming a professional software engineer.
